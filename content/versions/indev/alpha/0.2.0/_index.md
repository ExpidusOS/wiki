The first alpha version of ExpidusOS, it is an entire redesign of ExpidusOS.
A few of the biggest changes is replacing the XFCE fork with [Genesis Shell](/components/genesis-shell)
and basing the OS on [NixOS](https://nixos.org) instead of [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org).

## Major Changes

- Replace XFCE fork with Genesis Shell powered by Gokai
- Split into different variants with the flagship being Mainline
- Immutable root filesystem
- User and system data split into a "data filesystem"
